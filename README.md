## Advent of Code 2024

Welcome to my Advent of Code 2024 repository! Inside, you'll find my solutions written in two languages: C# and Go.

### What I Aimed For:

I set specific goals for each language based on my proficiency and what each language does best. The idea is to show different problem-solving styles and techniques across all languages.

### What's Inside:

- **C#:** I focused on keeping heap allocations to a minimum while still ensuring the code is readable. It’s a bit of a balancing act, but I enjoyed the challenge. :)
  
- **Go:** For Go, I leaned into its simplistic feature set, aiming for both good performance and clean solutions. Exploring Go’s approach was fun.

### What You'll Find:

Each language has its own folder with solutions to the AoC Star 1 challenges. Each folder includes a README with more details and instructions.

Note that since the input files can't be shared, you'll have to get them from the AoC site URL in each solution file to run the code. Sorry for that!

Feel free to take a look and share any thoughts or feedback!

Meryovi.-
